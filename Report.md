# Continuous Control

## Goal
To build a deep reinforcement learning agent that controls 20 robotic arms to maintain contact with the green balls. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each timestep when the agent's hand is in contact with the green balls. The environment is considered solved when the agents achive a mean score of +30.

## Learning Algorithm
To get started, there are a few high-level architecture decisions we need to make. First, we need to determine which types of algorithms are most suitable for the Reacher environment. Second, we need to determine how many "brains" we want controlling the actions of our agents.

### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
The [DDPG algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf) was chosen. The [DDPG template](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-pendulum) provided in the ND repo was used.  

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process was used to add noise to the action values at each timestep [ref](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf). 

In total, there are five hyperparameters related to this noise process. The final parameters were as follows:
```
OU_SIGMA = 0.2          # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
OU_THETA = 0.15         # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
EPSILON = 1.0           # explore->exploit noise process added to act step
EPSILON_DECAY = 1e-6    # decay rate for noise process
```

#### Learning Interval ([code])
In the first few versions of my implementation, the agent performed the learning step at every timestep. This made training very slow, and there was no apparent benefit to the agent's performance. So, I implemented an interval in which the learning step is only performed every 20 timesteps. As part of each learning step, the algorithm samples experiences from the buffer and runs the `Agent.learn()` method 10 times.

```python
LEARN_EVERY = 20        # learning timestep interval
LEARN_NUM = 10          # number of learning passes
```

You can find the learning interval implemented [here](https://github.com/tommytracey/DeepRL-P2-Continuous-Control/blob/master/ddpg_agent.py#L66) in the `Agent.step()` method in `ddpg_agent.py` of the source code.


#### Gradient Clipping
In early versions of my implementation, I had trouble getting my agent to learn. Or, rather, it would start to learn but then become very unstable and either plateau or collapse.

I suspect that one of the causes was outsized gradients. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an easy way to investigate this, although I'm sure there's some way of doing this in PyTorch. Absent this investigation, I hypothesize that many of the weights from my critic model were becoming quite large after just 5-10 episodes of training. (Note that at this point, I was running the learning process at every timestep, which made the problem worse.)

The issue of exploding gradients is described in layman's terms in [this post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/exploding-gradients-in-neural-networks/) by Jason Brownlee. Essentially, each layer of your net amplifies the gradient it receives. This becomes a problem when the lower layers of the network accumulate huge gradients, making their respective weight updates too large to allow the model to learn anything.

To combat this, I implemented gradient clipping using the `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` function. I set the function to "clip" the norm of the gradients at 1, therefore placing an upper limit on the size of the parameter updates, and preventing them from growing exponentially. Once this change was implemented, along with batch normalization (discussed in the next section), my model became much more stable and my agent started learning at a much faster rate.

You can find gradient clipping implemented [here](https://github.com/tommytracey/DeepRL-P2-Continuous-Control/blob/master/ddpg_agent.py#L112) in the "update critic" section of the `Agent.learn()` method, within `ddpg_agent.py` of the source code.

Note that this function is applied after the backward pass, but before the optimization step.

```python
# Compute critic loss
Q_expected = self.critic_local(states, actions)
critic_loss = F.mse_loss(Q_expected, Q_targets)
# Minimize the loss
self.critic_optimizer.zero_grad()
critic_loss.backward()
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.critic_local.parameters(), 1)
self.critic_optimizer.step()
```

#### Batch Normalization
I've used batch normalization many times in the past when building convolutional neural networks (CNN), in order to squash pixel values. But, it didn't occur to me how important it would be to this project. This was another aspect of the [Google DeepMind paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf) that proved tremendously useful in my implementation of this project.

Similar to the exploding gradient issue mentioned above, running computations on large input values and model parameters can inhibit learning. Batch normalization addresses this problem by scaling the features to be within the same range throughout the model and across different environments and units. In additional to normalizing each dimension to have unit mean and variance, the range of values is often much smaller, typically between 0 and 1.

Initially, I added batch normalization between every layer in both the actor and critic models. However, this may have been overkill, and seemed to prolong training time. I eventually reduced the use of batch normalization to just the outputs of the first fully-connected layers of both the actor and critic models.

You can find batch normalization implemented [here](https://github.com/tommytracey/DeepRL-P2-Continuous-Control/blob/master/model.py#L41) for the actor, and [here](https://github.com/tommytracey/DeepRL-P2-Continuous-Control/blob/master/model.py#L75) for the critic, within `model.py` of the source code.

```python
# actor forward pass
def forward(self, state):
    """Build an actor (policy) network that maps states -> actions."""
    x = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fc1(state)))
    x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
    return F.tanh(self.fc3(x))
```
```python
# critic forward pass
def forward(self, state, action):
    """Build a critic (value) network that maps (state, action) pairs -> Q-values."""
    xs = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fcs1(state)))
    x = torch.cat((xs, action), dim=1)
    x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
    return self.fc3(x)
```


#### Experience Replay
Experience replay allows the RL agent to learn from past experience.

As with DQN in the previous project, DDPG also utilizes a replay buffer to gather experiences from each agent. Each experience is stored in a replay buffer as the agent interacts with the environment. In this project, there is one central replay buffer utilized by all 20 agents, therefore allowing agents to learn from each others' experiences.

The replay buffer contains a collection of experience tuples with the state, action, reward, and next state `(s, a, r, s')`. Each agent samples from this buffer as part of the learning step. Experiences are sampled randomly, so that the data is uncorrelated. This prevents action values from oscillating or diverging catastrophically, since a naive algorithm could otherwise become biased by correlations between sequential experience tuples.

Also, experience replay improves learning through repetition. By doing multiple passes over the data, our agents have multiple opportunities to learn from a single experience tuple. This is particularly useful for state-action pairs that occur infrequently within the environment.

The implementation of the replay buffer can be found [here](https://github.com/tommytracey/DeepRL-P2-Continuous-Control/blob/master/ddpg_agent.py#L167) in the `ddpg_agent.py` file of the source code.


### 4. Results
Once all of the various components of the algorithm were in place, my agent was able to solve the 20 agent Reacher environment. Again, the performance goal is an average reward of at least +30 over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents.

The graph below shows the final results. The best performing agent was able to solve the environment starting with the 12th episode, with a top mean score of 39.3 in the 79th episode. The complete set of results and steps can be found in [this notebook](Continuous_Control_v8.ipynb).

## Future Improvements
- **Experiment with other algorithms** &mdash; Tuning the DDPG algorithm required a lot of trial and error. Perhaps another algorithm such as [Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477), [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms), or [Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08617) would be more robust.
- **Add *prioritized* experience replay** &mdash; Rather than selecting experience tuples randomly, prioritized replay selects experiences based on a priority value that is correlated with the magnitude of error. This can improve learning by increasing the probability that rare and important experience vectors are sampled.
